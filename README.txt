Crazy Ostrich is a simple 3D platformer in which you control an ostrich with a green cap to complete different objectives inside of a square corral before time runs out. Made entirely in Blender versions 2.67 and 2.78.

To launch the game, select the Crazy Ostrich.exe file, which needs to remain in the same directory as all .dll and .blend files. enjoy!
